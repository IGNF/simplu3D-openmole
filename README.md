# Simplu3D-OpenMole
============

This projects contains codes to allow distribution and exploration of [SimPLU3D](https://github.com/IGNF/simplu3D) model thanks to [OpenMole](https://www.openmole.org/) library.

Conditions for use
---------------------
This software is free to use under CeCILL license. However, if you use this library in a research paper, you are kindly requested to acknowledge the use of this software.

Furthermore, we are interested in every feedbacks about this library if you find it useful, if you want to contribute or if you have some suggestions to improve it.


Exploration method
---------------------
Using the Pattern Search Exploration (PSE) method allows the production of diversity of simulation models outputs. This methods is applied on SimPLU3D model in order to generate a variety of built configurations according to external measure (density, distribution of height, etc.).

[More information, implementation and results are provided in the dedicated branch (results_pse)](https://github.com/IGNF/simplu3D-openmole/tree/results_pse)
