PSE exhibit configurations of simPLU outputspace 

Three of the outputspace dimensions (measures) are chosen to display these configurations as a 3D scatter plot (a fourth measure is used through a colourscale)

The scatterplot can be filtered by choosing input parameter space bounds.

Hovering (or clicking) a point in the scatterplot display the corresponding
